    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c1">In the days after the accident, the Chen family filed a $200-million civil suit naming five corporations and nine individuals involved in the film’s production, reflecting early uncertainty about who was responsible.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c1">Because the accident simultaneously involved an aircraft crash, a labour code violation, and a criminal matter, jurisdiction was split among the NTSB, Cal/OSHA, and the L.A. Sheriff’s Department, creating procedural confusion and weakening investigative authority. With no single agency clearly in charge, influential witnesses—particularly production and studio executives—had greater latitude to maneuver, delay cooperation, and exploit jurisdictional gaps, significantly limiting the police and prosecutors' leverage in the critical early stages. By the time the NTSB and Cal/OSHA completed their investigations at the end of 1982, only a single detective and a single D.A. remained to build the criminal case, severely disadvantaged against a formidable legal defense team funded by studios and insurers motivated to avoid a windfall in the pending civil trial. Although the prosecution nearly collapsed due to a lack of witness testimony—several witnesses later testified about serious threats of blacklisting—a breakthrough in early 1983 enabled the D.A. to successfully navigate the case through a Grand Jury hearing (June 1983), a preliminary hearing (February 1984), and an appeal (November 1984), until the defense had exhausted all legal options.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c4">Finally, in a landmark trial in 1986-87, co-producer/writer/director, John Landis (</span>
      <span class="c4 c11">Animal House, The Blues Brothers</span>
      <span class="c1">), along with two production subordinates, and two technicians, faced Involuntary Manslaughter charges for the deaths. Landis and his Associate Producer and Production Manager—who faced two counts specifically for the illegal hiring—conceded that they decided to hire the children without permits but said they only did so because of the late hour, not because they ever seriously believed the scene was dangerous as planned. The filmmakers were eventually acquitted, with the civil case settled during closing arguments for approximately $2-million dollars per family.</span>

Marshall was informed about Landis’s intentions by a casting agent over a month in advance; whose signature appears on the cheque used to pay the children for their first night of work; whose accountant was reported by a production assistant to have provided her an envelope full of cash on the day of the second night; who was on-set both nights the children were there, including during earlier shots with the children which also constituted legal violations; who ordered the set cleared; and who was documented by Landis’s secretary as raiding Landis’s office for production materials the morning after the accident. Landis even testified that Marshall </span>
      <span class="c4 c11 c14">explicitly approved the illegal hiring</span>
      <span class="c6 c4">, a narrative maintained by Landis’s two subordinates. This is especially significant since Marshall was an executive officer at both Twilight Zone Productions, and the payroll company contracted by Warner Bros to act as a watchdog on the production’s spending, which, legally-speaking, made him a major person of interest. Domestic and international subpoenas were issued for Marshall’s testimony, but Marshall spent most of the next four years overseas and out of reach. By the time Marshall finally surfaced, as the result of an Interpol “Stop and Hold” order, the prosecution and defense had already rested their cases, and his testimony was no longer of any use.</span>

      <span class="c4">Spielberg (age 36) discovered the project during an invitation to browse Warner Bros’ development slate in January of 1982; he brought it to Landis in March, proposing a collaboration, knowing Landis also loved the intellectual property. Although the two first met at Martha’s Vineyard in 1974, when Landis was considered as a screenwriter for what would become </span>
      <span class="c4 c11">Close Encounters</span>
      <span class="c4">, they only became friendly in 1978, after Spielberg reached out to Landis following the success of </span>
      <span class="c4 c11">Animal House</span>
      <span class="c4">. As detailed by Chain (Ch. 6) the two exhibited behaviour reflective of a passive-aggressive friendship, with Landis perceiving that Spielberg had used some of his ideas for </span>
      <span class="c4 c11">Close Encounters </span>
      <span class="c1">without compensation at a time in his career when he was desperate for an opportunity. In her notorious Hollywood tell-all, Julia Phillips claimed: “Steven hated him, although Michael and I always wondered if he felt threatened, Landis being so child-prodigy and all, Steven pretty much feeling he had the corner on that arena. There’s always someone younger than you.”</span>

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c4">According to accounts of the early stages of production, Spielberg was heavily invested in the development of the film, both as a whole, and with regards to his own originally-planned sequence. Prior to the accident, the </span>
      <span class="c4 c11">Twilight Zone </span>
      <span class="c4">segments were going to be more continuous and less discrete than they ended up becoming, with recurring characters, seamless segues, and winks to earlier sequences, according to Joe Dante (</span>

It’s unlikely the studio would have released the trailer without Spielberg’s approval. Spielberg took out his own two ads (see adjacent).

      <span class="c4">The problem presented by Marshall’s actions, in terms of resolving the facts of the accident, is the qu</span>
      <span class="c4">estion of what motivated it. Marshall (age 36) had recently co-founded Amblin Entertainment, Ltd., with his girlfriend, Kathleen Kennedy (age 27), and their boss and friend, Steven Spielberg. When they met, Spielberg’s career was at a turning point. His last three movies, </span>

      <span class="c4">(1975), </span>
      <span class="c4 c11">Close Encounters of the Third Kind </span>

      <span class="c4 c11">1941 </span>

      <span class="c4 c11">1941, </span>
      <span class="c4">flopped both critically and commercially. Spielberg consciously shifted gears starting with </span>
      <span class="c4 c11">Raiders of the Lost Ark</span>
      <span class="c4">, with newly disciplined production procedures, lead by Marshall—whom Spielberg remembered favorably from a passing encounter on the set of a Peter Bogdanovich movie in 1974—and Kennedy, who had only been a Production Assistant on </span>
      <span class="c4 c11">1941</span>

      <span class="c4">Beyond negligently facilitating the hiring unwittingly despite being warned, Marshall is implicated in consciously facilitating the hiring, by the actions of Twilight Zone production accountant, Bonne Radford.

She is also reported to have given a Production Assistant an envelope full of cash from an address on the Warner Bros lot the day before the accident. If these witnesses are to be believed, then on whose authority was Radford facilitating this illegal act? It’s unlikely she would have done so on behalf of the Associate Producer or Landis. And if Marshall—as stands to reason—told her to do it, then who told Marshall? Why would Marshall go out on a limb to facilitate John Landis’s being able to film two children at night for a special effects scene?</span>

Sometime earlier—around 4:00am, according to Landis—the 1st AD informed him it would not be possible to complete the three major special effects setups and various pick-ups they still had left on the schedule to shoot. Landis said he confirmed it with Marshall. It was only then as they were wrapping up that the Associate Producer, as he was paying the parents out in cash, asked them if they could come back the next night. He said that they would finish up “first thing,” within an hour or an hour and a half.</span>

    <p class="c16 c13">
      <span class="c1">The issue involved in the "Twilight Zone" case as charged by your office is whether the defendants knew about a serious danger on the set and chose to disregard that danger. Simple interviews with Spielberg, Marshall, and Kennedy would reveal that these highly placed and acknowledged experts knew that a scene was being shot in their own movie in which actors were being used in a scene with a helicopter and special effects. These participants knew the elements of the scene and would have stopped the production had they ever thought that special effects could not be safely used with actors and helicopters. For Kesselman to have pursued the conspiracy to employ minors without a permit would have resulted in the destruction of his manslaughter case against the five targeted defendants.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c16 c13">
      <span class="c1">Frank Marshall was on the set on the night of the accident as well as on the previous night. Marshall saw the children present and saw them in the 9:30 shot in which they were held by Vic Morrow in a scene with a helicopter and special effects. Marshall was present the whole evening and observed the 11:30 sequence involving Morrow, the 2:00 rehearsal as well as the scene in which the accident occurred. Marshall was the producer of the "Twilight Zone" and participated at meetings in which the hiring of the children was discussed and agreed upon. Since the statute of limitations has now expired, he has no fifth amendment right and if asked will hopefully tell the truth. But what must be emphasized again is the fact that his participation in the hiring of the children without permits was viewed as a "technical" violation that in no way meant that anyone was in danger.</span>

    <p class="c16 c13">
      <span class="c1">Marshall and Kennedy could verify that Kennedy called the Department of Labor to determine whether permits could be obtained for minors after hours. It was only after her call received a negative response, that the decision was made to employ the children without permits. Again, Ms. Kennedy had no belief that there was any danger even though she was intimately acquainted with the nature of the shot and the use of the children. In fact, she was on the set the prior night when the scenes filmed on the fatal night were scheduled to be shot.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c13 c16">
      <span class="c1">With respect to Mr. Spielberg, Marshall and Kennedy will be able to state whether he knew that children were to be employed without permits. It could be reasonably inferred that given the close relationship between Spielberg, Marshall and Kennedy and Spielberg’s close supervision of his own movies, that it would be almost inconceivable that Marshall and Kennedy would not tell Spielberg that children were to be employed without permits on Spielberg’s own movie.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c16 c13">
      <span class="c1">Your office's statement that there was an exhaustive investigation is not only false with respect to Marshall, but is also false with respect to Spielberg. Spielberg was able to deflect the investigation away from himself by simply submitting a letter stating that he was not on the set the night of the accident. His full and complete knowledge and approval of what was to take place must be assumed and never has been disputed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c16 c13">
      <span class="c1">What other major witness could avoid questioning by signing a piece of paper? Your office never asked Spielberg a single question about the accident or the hiring of the children. Your claim that Spielberg was "unavailable" is simply false.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c16 c13">
      <span class="c4">Associate Producer Kathleen Kennedy (Spielberg segment) herself made the blind call to the Department of Labor. It was only when she received a negative reply to a question of getting permits for night work that the decision was made to employ the children without permits. Kennedy was on the set the night before the accident when the children were present and the special effects were being set up while the helicopter rehearsed. Why has she not been interviewed?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c1">Spielberg (or his representatives) gave four statements directed to the matter over the years. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c1">First, in response to the Chen family civil lawsuit filed on August 2nd, 1982: “Spielberg is informed and believes and thereon alleges that at the time and place of the events complained of, plaintiffs and each of them were not exercising ordinary care, caution or prudence to prevent the injuries sustained by them or by decedent and that, therefore, the injuries alleged were proximately caused by the negligence or comparative negligence of the plaintiffs." </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c1">Second, in response to the NTSB interview of a special effects truck driver on November 5th, 1982:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3 c5 c13">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c3 c13">
      <span class="c4">Mr. Pitman [sic] stated that following the crash scene, he had assisted Mr. Landis and one of the children's parents in obtaining a </span>
      <span class="c4 c12">vehicle**</span>
      <span class="c1"> to leave the set, and likewise, had secured a vehicle for STEVEN SPIELBERG to leave the set. Following this he left the set, driving the 10-ton powder truck followed by Ted, who was driving the special effects pickup truck. He stated that both of them drove directly to the Burbank Studios. He stated that it was the following day when he and members of the special effects crew met at the Burbank Studios and off-loaded material. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c1">But Pittman’s testimony was dubious, as he’d already admitted to being drunk on set. So of course he must  be lying.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c1">Spielberg replied to the NTSB’s inquiry on the matter by way of a signed affidavit: </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c3 c13">
      <span class="c4">In response to your request, I was never at the Indian Dunes location of </span>
      <span class="c4 c11">Twilight Zone </span>
      <span class="c1">on the night of the accident or at any other time. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct, executed at Los Angeles, California, this first day of December, 1982.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3 c5 c13">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c1">Pittman admitted he’d probably had Spielberg confused with Marshall.</span>

      <span class="c4">Third, a short comment to </span>
      <span class="c4 c11">Los Angeles Times</span>
      <span class="c1"> Reporter Dale Pollock:</span>

    <p class="c3 c13">
      <span class="c4">This has been the most interesting year of my film career… It has mixed the best, the success of </span>

      <span class="c4 c11">Twilight Zone </span>
      <span class="c4">tragedy. A mixture of ecstasy and grief. It's made me grow up a little more. The accident cast a pall on all 150 people who worked on this production. We are still just sick to the center of our souls. I don't know anybody who it </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c3 c13">
      <span class="c4">A movie is a fantasy—it's light and shadow flickering on a screen. No movie is worth dying for. I think people are standing up much more now than ever before to producers and directors who ask too much. If something isn't safe, it's the right and responsibility of every actor or crew member to yell, 'Cut!'" (</span>

    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c4">Suffice to say, Marshall had his own reasons for evading investigators. The question of whether Marshall knew the children were going to be used not only for the 9:30pm shot, but the 2:20am shot as well is unclear. The Locations Manager, Richard Vane, who had worked with Marshall on </span>
      <span class="c4 c11">Poltergeist</span>
      <span class="c1">, testified once, at the Grand Jury, that during the final shot Marshall, who was standing beside him, turned to say, “those are dolls he’s picking up, aren’t they?” But Vane was the highest ranking member of the production to admit to participating in a conspiracy to conceal the presence of the children from a particular Fire Safety Officer known to be trained as an on-set Teacher and Child Welfare Worker, up to and including the 2:20am shot.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3 c5">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c4">Spielberg never distanced himself from Marshall despite the negligence or subpoenas. Not only Marshall, but Vane and Radford also continued to flourish within the Amblin organization, with Vane graduating to Producer with </span>
      <span class="c4 c11">Harry and the Hendersons </span>
      <span class="c4">in 1987, and Radford graduating to Producer with </span>

    <p class="c3">
      <span class="c1">The two children were only added to Landis’s segment with the third draft of the script, dated June 13th, 1982. In the story, Morrow’s character—an embittered bigot—delivers a tirade to his friends in a bar, and then steps out into Nazi-occupied France. Shortly, he is mistaken for Jewish and chased by the officers, before time-jumping again to the deep south, where he continues to be chased, but now by the KKK. Next, he finds himself in Vietnam, where he finds himself set upon—not by Vietnamese soldiers, who pass by his hiding spot—but by U.S. infantry. He is finally buffeted back to the Nazi timeline, where he is hauled to a half-filled freight car headed for the death camps. He reaches out of the slats to his friends, whom he can now see stumbling out of the bar, but they can’t hear his cries.</span>
